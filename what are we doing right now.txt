what are we doing right now:

1. get start and end destination
2. finding all the possible path between them
3. check how much path are there!
4. if there is only one path then render it.
5. if there are 2 paths:
6. find the shortest path
7. render the shortest path first and then the 2nd path
8. now we will try to decide which heading we should put for the both paths.
9. count how much time metro will change it's line for the shortest path.
10. if there is no change of line in shortest path then it is the fastest route too
11. if not then count how much time metro will change it's line for the 2nd path.
12. now compare line change for both path and find which path contain least line change, that path is the fastest.
13. now we will give heading to the first column:
14. if shortest path is the fastest path then heading will be "Fastest Route(and Shortest Route too)" if not then "Shortest Route(May need to change Metro!)"
15. now we will give heading to the 2nd column:
16. if shortest path is the fastest path then heading will be "Alternate Route(longer Route)" if not then "Fastest Route(No need to change Metro)"

what we should be doing right now:

1. get start and end destination
2. finding all the possible path between them
3. check how much path are there!
4. if there is only one path then render it.
5. if there are 2 paths:
6. find the shortest path
7. count how much time metro will switch it's line for the shortest path.
8. if there is no switch of line in shortest path then it is the fastest route too
9. if not then count how much time metro will change it's line for the 2nd path.
10. now compare line change for both path and find which path contain least line change, that path is the fastest.

render the shortest path first and then the 2nd path
now we will try to decide which heading we should put for the both paths.
